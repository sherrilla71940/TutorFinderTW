In both the client and server you will need to set up your environmental variables (port and host). The server uses these variables to start the server, and the client uses the variables to make http requests to the correct url. Each env file is located at the root of the folder (client and server).

### Starting the backend API:

Move into the server folder in your terminal and type **npm run serve**. This will compile all your server TypeScript files and start your server on the host and port you specified in your server env file.

### Starting the frontend server:

Move into the client folder in your terminal and type **npm run start**. This will start your React server and serve your static files.
